# Anchored Region

The "anchored-region" component is a container that can position itself
relative to another html element in the same document referred to as the
"anchor". Additionally, the component can choose its position based on the
available space between the anchor element and the a "viewport" element (the
document is used as viewport if not otherwise specified).

An anchored-region is primarily intended to be used as the positioning
element within other components like tooltips or flyout menus.

Note that this page contains way more instances of anchored-region than is
expected in a normal scenario. Authors should consider performance impacts of
many instances.

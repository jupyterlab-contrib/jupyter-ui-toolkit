## Introduction

The UI Toolkit is a component library for building web interfaces in Jupyter ecosystem (JupyterHub,
Jupyter Widgets, JupyterLab,...).

Features of the library include:

- **Implements the Jupyter design language:** All components follow the design language of Jupyter
  â€“ enabling developers to create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of
  the ecosystem.
- **Automatic support for color themes:** All components are designed with theming in mind and will
  automatically display the current application theme.
- **Use any tech stack:** The library ships as a set of web components, meaning developers can use
  the toolkit no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) their extension is built with.
- **Accessible out of the box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and
  keyboard navigation.

This repository contains three packages:

- [`@jupyter/web-components`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/components/):
  The main package defining the web components.
- [`@jupyter/react-components`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/react-components):
  Wrapped the web components to use them with [React](https://reactjs.org).
- [`jupyter-ui-demo`](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/tree/main/packages/lab-example):
  Unpublished JupyterLab extension to demonstrate the integration of the toolkit.

Those features are brought through the [Fast Design](https://www.fast.design/). And it is inspired
by the [WebView toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit)
as example for creating a customized toolkit.

## Release

The UI Toolkit is currently in a proof of concept. Track progress towards 1.0 [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyter-ui-toolkit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Av1.0).
Styles and API are not guarantee between minor versions prior to v1.0.0.

## Installation

### From NPM

To install the `web-components` library, use either `npm` or `yarn` as follows:

```shell
npm install --save @jupyter/web-components
```

```shell
yarn add @jupyter/web-components
```

> If you need the React components of the toolkit, you need to install `@jupyter/react-components`.

### From CDN

A pre-bundled script that contains all APIs needed to use Jupyter UI Toolkit is available on CDN. You can use this script by adding [`type="module"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) to the script element and then importing from the CDN.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@jupyter/web-components"></script>
  </head>
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

The above CDN location points to the latest release of `@jupyter/web-components`. It is advised that when you deploy your site or app, you import the specific version you have developed and tested with.

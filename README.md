## Introduction

The UI Toolkit is a component library for building web interfaces in Jupyter ecosystem (JupyterHub, Jupyter Widgets, JupyterLab,...).

Features of the library include:

- **Implements the Jupyter design language:** All components follow the design language of Jupyter â€“ enabling developers to create extensions that have a consistent look and feel with the rest of the ecosystem.
- **Automatic support for color themes:** All components are designed with theming in mind and will automatically display the current application theme.
- **Use any tech stack:** The library ships as a set of web components, meaning developers can use the toolkit no matter what tech stack (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) their extension is built with.
- **Accessible out of the box:** All components ship with web standard compliant ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

Note this project started as a fork of the [WebView toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-webview-ui-toolkit) (licensed under MIT) on which Jupyter design specification. The fundamental technology used is [Fast Design](https://www.fast.design/).
